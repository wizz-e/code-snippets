## 🚀 Quick Start

### Adding a New Snippet

1. Navigate to the appropriate language directory under `snippets/`
2. Create a new file with a descriptive name
3. Add your code with clear comments explaining its purpose
4. Update the directory's README if adding a new category

### Adding a Template

1. Navigate to the `templates/` directory
2. Create your template file with placeholder values
3. Document required customizations in comments

### Adding a Utility

1. Navigate to the `utilities/` directory
2. Add your utility script
3. Make it executable if it's a script
4. Include usage documentation in comments/docstrings

## 📚 Directory Details

### Snippets
Contains small, focused code examples organized by programming language. Each language has its own subdirectory for better organization.

### Templates
Reusable starter files and boilerplates for common project types or patterns. Copy and customize these for new projects.

### Utilities
Standalone scripts and tools that perform specific tasks. These are typically more complete than snippets and can be run directly.

### Resources
Reference materials, cheat sheets, guides, and curated links to helpful documentation.

### Docs
Comprehensive documentation about the repository structure, contribution guidelines, and detailed examples.

## 🤝 Contributing

When adding new content:

1. **Be organized** - Place files in the correct directories
2. **Use clear names** - File names should describe their purpose
3. **Add comments** - Explain what the code does and how to use it
4. **Keep it focused** - Each snippet should do one thing well
5. **Test your code** - Ensure snippets work as expected

## 📖 Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with underscores: `my_function.py`
- Be descriptive: `parse_json_file.js` not `parser.js`
- Include the file extension appropriate for the language
- For related snippets, use a common prefix: `auth_login.py`, `auth_logout.py`

## 🔍 Finding Snippets

- Browse by language in the `snippets/` directory
- Check `templates/` for project starters
- Look in `utilities/` for ready-to-use tools
- Consult `resources/` for learning materials

## 📝 License

This is a personal collection. Please respect any license terms included with individual snippets or templates.

## 🌟 Tips

- **Use version control** - Each snippet is tracked, so you can see its history
- **Create subdirectories** - Group related snippets within language folders
- **Link to sources** - If a snippet is adapted from somewhere, credit the source
- **Keep it simple** - Snippets should be easy to understand and use
